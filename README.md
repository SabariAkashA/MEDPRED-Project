## Leveraging Deep Learning for Accurate Patient Medication Cost Forecasting
This project develops a Feed Forward Neural Network–based model to predict patient medical costs using demographic, clinical, and administrative data, enabling accurate cost forecasting, improved hospital budgeting, efficient insurance claim processing, and enhanced transparency in healthcare financial planning.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project focuses on predicting patient medical costs using a deep learning approach based on a Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN). By analyzing patient demographics, clinical information, treatment details, and hospital records, the system learns complex non-linear relationships to accurately forecast medical expenses. The model supports hospitals and insurance providers in budgeting, claim assessment, and decision-making while improving cost transparency for patients.
